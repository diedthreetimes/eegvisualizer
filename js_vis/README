In order to run you need to wrap the connection from the DSI machine in a websocket.

For this websockify (https://github.com/novnc/websockify) is used. 

Specifically the steps are:

For Dev work
$ ../mock_eeg_server/server.rb
$ websocket/websockify.rb localhost:8080 localhost:8844

For Real use
* Launch the tcp/ip protocol of DSIStreamer on port 8844
$ websocket/websockify.rb localhost:8080 <path_to_dsistreamer_machine>:8844

We then need to serve the js assets this can be done in a variety of ways but is simple using npm's http-server
$ npm install http-server -g
$ cd js; http-server -p 8081

Then browse to http://127.0.0.1:8081/
